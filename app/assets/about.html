    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <div class="justify">
        <p>I graduated Bachelor of Science, major in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne with
            First Class Honours. Not that I am proud of it, but I almost feel obliged to mention given my family spent a
            fortune to successfully complete my academic life.</p>

        <p>Unlike modern kids, I went down the path of full independence a soon as I started my uni life, working like a
            dog to afford rent and food since the first year. This made me quickly realize how important loving your job
            is in order to not kill yourself. This attitude really helped me to land in a job I love as soon as I
            graduated.</p>

        <div class="awards show-mobile">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>I invested a heavy chunk of my academic life attending (and winning) hackathons, as you can guess from the
            awards above. In this, I gained my valuable lessons of efficient teamwork and business bullshit. PMs
            generally love me for understanding commercial aspects and politics, but being an efficient code monkey at
            the same time. But that's only until I bluntly criticize how shit the team's workflow or decisions are..</p>

        <p>Leading a team of
            <del>goons</del>
            developers generally gives headache and losing temper but I genuinely love leading the
            <del>fools</del>
            developers to battle, whether that be assisting from behind or being foremost to take the charge. I am
            always seeking ways on how to lead better, experimenting different techniques at work, game studio and
            university projects.

    <h2 class="flip-horz">The Name</h2>
    <div class="justify no-gap">
        <p>"Sanmu" has been derived from my old online name, "Bermuda" or "Bermuda-UT".</p>
        <p>Keeping my favourite part of the word "mu" in "Bermuda", I added "San" - which means number three in Chinese
            to represent the triangle of Bermuda. No, I am not Chinese.</p>
