    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Graduated Bachelor of Science, major in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne</p>
    <p>Awarded across four hackathons. Most notably, achieved 1st in UNIHACK Melbourne 2016</p>
    <p>Been working like a dog to afford rent and food since first year of university</p>
    <p>Currently working as IoT Software Engineer, working from low-level embedded systems to high-level web
        applications</p>

    <h2>The Name</h2>
    <p>"Sanmu" has been derived from my old online name, "Bermuda" or "Bermuda-UT"</p>
    <p>Keeping my favourite part of the word "mu" in "Bermuda", I added "San" - which means number three in Chinese to
        represent the triangle of Bermuda</p>
