    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <div class="justify">
        <p>I graduated Bachelor of Science, major in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne with
            <i>First Class Honours</i> on December 2017.
            Not that I'm proud of it, but I almost feel obliged to mention given my family spent a <i>fortune</i> to
            successfully complete my academic life.
            This feeling is especially highlighted by the fact that my degree is useless at current point in time (and
            I'm hoping it's a long-term investment..).</p>

        <p>Unlike modern kids, I went down the path of full naive independence a soon as I started my uni life, working
            like a dog to afford rent and food starting my second semester.
            This made me quickly realize how important loving your job is in order to not kill yourself.
            But realization meant nothing in practice when you had to pay back your credit card and pay rent next month.
            It rather helped me develop an attitude to work for something I love in extreme passion and
            gratefulness.</p>

        <p>I invested a heavy chunk of my academic life attending (and winning) hackathons, as you can guess from the
            awards above.
            In this, I gained my valuable experience of efficient teamwork and dealing with business bullshit.
            PMs generally love me for understanding commercial aspects and politics, but being an efficient code monkey
            at the same time.
            But that's only until I bluntly criticize how shit the team's workflow or decisions are.. ;)</p>

        <p>Leading a team of
            <del>goons</del>
            developers generally tags along with a headache and hot temper but I genuinely love leading the
            <del>fools</del>
            developers to battle, whether that's aggressive pushing from behind or being foremost to take the charge.
            I am always seeking ways on how to lead better, experimenting different techniques at work and game studio,
            just like I had done or university projects.

    <h2 class="flip-horz">The Name</h2>
    <div class="justify no-gap">
        <p>"Sanmu" has been derived from my old online name, "Bermuda" or "Bermuda-UT".
            For a short period, I went by the name of "muda".
            This naming scheme is derived from how Koreans call non-strangers by their first names (in Korea, family
            name comes first, so in this case, "Ber" was considered as a family name, "muda" as the first).
            Then, I added "San" - which means number three in Chinese - to represent the triangle in the original name
            "Bermuda".</p>
