            <p>My dream of having my own indie-game studio kind-of formulated to reality during university.
              It was a great excuse for me to attened hackathons with the team and grow various skills, both technical and non-technical.
              Casual game development contiued throughout university, making games for fun.
              However after graduation, I wanted to take the studio to next-level and looked out for contract works.
              In 2018, the studio successfully worked and completed a client game project.
