# Hungry World
[Blog](https://mallocsizeof.me)

Bermuda (Sanmu)'s blog created using [Brunch](http://brunch.io).  
`brunch new dir -s es6` was the starting point of the project.

## Setup
* Install:
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io) `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.

## QnA
* Can I use this as a starting point for my blog?
    * Yes, feel free to do so. Just be nice and give me some credits :P
* Will the game part be an isolated project at one point?
    * Yes, but that probably is in the far future.
